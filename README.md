# Human-Auditory-system-based-Audio-Watermarking
The main purpose of this work is to retain the original sound quality so that listener could not feel change in sound.
By considering the characteristics of human auditory system it is possible to achieve the
imperceptibility, robustness. 
Spread spectrum technique is used here to embed watermark, in this technique watermark is
embedded into frequency frames(Set of frequencies) which makes it more secure and reliable
than inserting watermark into single sample.
